Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game supports two players who take turns playing as 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one of the players wins by aligning three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when all spots on the grid are filled (a draw).

Features:
Two-player gameplay: Players take turns to mark 'X' or 'O' on the board.
Automatic Win Check: The game automatically checks for a winner after every turn.
Dynamic Board: The game board is updated after every move, showing the current state of the grid.
User Input Validation: Players are asked to input valid values (0-8) for their moves.
Match Ending Conditions: The match ends when either player wins or the grid is full with no winner.
How to Play:
Run the script in your Python environment.
The game will display the current state of the board after each move.
Players will alternate taking turns to place their mark ('X' or 'O') on the grid by entering a number from 0-8, corresponding to the grid positions.
The game ends when either 'X' or 'O' wins or if the board is filled without a winner (a draw).

checkWin(xState, zState): Checks whether 'X' or 'O' has won the game by comparing the current grid state to predefined winning combinations.
Main Game Loop: The game continues in a loop until there is a winner or a draw.
Requirements:
Python 3.x or higher
Installation:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
